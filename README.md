This repository contains the smart contract code and front-end React dapp for JustCause (v1). The app uses Truffle as a development environment for testing and deployment tasks.

# What is JustCause?

JustCause is a crowdfunding platform that allows users to leverage the power of defi to fund causes that are important to them. We use an innovative funding mechanism to allow users to contribute to public goods, charitable organizations, DAOs, local/global/personal causes, and much more.

Users are able to participate as either Contributors or Pool Creators. Pool Creators generate JustCause Pools representing a cause in need of funding. Contributors deposit tokens into JustCause Pools which in turn deposit them into Aaveâ€™s lending protocol. The interest earned is donated to the cause associated with the Pool. When Contributors need access to their funds, they simply withdraw their original deposit and the interest accrued is left behind for the cause.
